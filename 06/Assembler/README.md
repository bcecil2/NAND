This assembler was written in ruby, and was designed based on the text "The Elements of Computing Systems" by Nisan and Schocken.
It assembles programs written for the HACK computer in machine readable code. It is a two pass assembler and equipped with elementary symbol handling capabilities.

To test out the assembler for your self download the assembler folder and invoke the main.rb function from your favorite shell.
It takes in exactly one file that MUST have a .asm extenstion name, the subsequent file containg the binary instructions will be created and placed in the same folder as the .asm file and will have the same name but a .hack extension.
